    Malappuram was the military head quarters from ancient times.
During the Sangam period Eranadan Malappuram was under the Chera
Empire. The King of Mysore, Hydarali, conquered the places and her son,
Tipu Sultan, handed over the area to the British as part of Srirangapattanam
treaty. The British established the Haigh Barracks on top of the hill, at the
bank of the Kadalundi river, to station their forces, where once Tipu had a
fort. Main Barracks has now been turned into the seat of district
administration.
 This district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings
against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921.
It was a famous centre for Hindu - Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy and
a place of cultural heritage. Malappuram has a rich and eventful history. It
was the military headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient
